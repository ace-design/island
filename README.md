Island is a programming game designed as a support for Software Engineering classes at the undergraduate level. 

It leverages [map generation techniques](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/) to build the map of an Island. Thus, students can create their own **explorer bots** to discover and exploit the amazing resources available on the Island.

This game is developed at Université Nice-Sophia Antipolis, and used in the Polytech'Nice Sophia curriculum. From a research point of view, it is also exploited to support the teaching of variability modelling at the graduate level.
